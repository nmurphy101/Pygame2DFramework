Major:
1. Working Main menu - DONE
2. Working pause menu - DONE
3. Working settings menu - DONE
    a. connected to a config file - DONE
4. Data structure for objects to optimize collision checking and spawning
    a. "Windows" -> "Chunks" -> "tiles"
5. Optimize collision checks to be more generic instead of specific so
   other objects can get their collisions checked.
6. Player AI -> Minor #9, #10, #11, #15 - WIP
7. additional settings
    - Volume control
    - Window size control
8. More advanced collision logic for entity interactions
  - like not just killing the other obj when colliding


Minor:
9. immobile enemies
    a. "walls" for future level design
    b. explosive mine
10. moving enemies - DONE
11. shooting enemies
    a. Only does damage to hit section (tail segment or head)
12. consumable-items/pick-ups in level
13. Level design
    a. Win condition to get to next level (probably reach a certain score)
    b. window shifts towards the direction of the edge of the window the player
       goes.
    c. level generated with different "scenes"/"windows" as tiles connected.
        i. Procedual generation of levels
14. Environmental effects - WIP
    a. wormhole/teleportation to different areas/challenges
        i. Teleport to other portal - DONE
15. AI needs upgrade
    a. AI can be improved by a few things:
        i. Utilize diagonal movement
        ii. Utilize teleporters
        iii. increase sight
        iv. Better logic for not locking self in a tail cage
        v. increase speed
        vi. increase growth amount
    b. AI can be handicaped by a few things:
        i. decrease speed
        ii. decrease growth amount
        iii. Disalow teleporters
        iv. decrease sight

Bugs:
1. Food was able to spawn onto a portal/tail... That's not right...
2. The game slows down after awhile with more tail segments
